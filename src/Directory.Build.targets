    <!--
        Disable nullable support on .NET Core 2.1, .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework
        because the BCL on these frameworks does not have nullable annotations
        leading to false-positives in the nullable analysis.

        Note: this is implemented as target instead of a plain property group in Directory.Build.props
        becasue teh condition requires $(TargetFrameworkIdentifier) to be set which it is not
        at the time properties are evaluated
    -->
