# DemoEnum Enum

**Namespace:** [DemoProject](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** DemoProject

An example of an user\-defined enum meant

```csharp
public enum DemoEnum
{
    Item1 = 0,
    Item2 = 1,
    AnotherItem = 2
}
```

**Inheritance:** object → ValueType → Enum → DemoEnum

## Remarks

This page demonstrates how the generated documentation for structs looks like. The same layout is used for classes, structs, interfaces, and enums.

A more detailed description of type documentation can be seen in the documentation of [DemoClass](../DemoClass/index.md)

In contrast to other kinds of types, the definition section for enum does include the list of possible values of the enum including the numeric value.

Another difference to other types is that for enum values, there won't be generated a separate page for every field

## Fields

| Name        | Description            |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| AnotherItem | Yet another enum value |
| Item1       | Enum value "Item1"     |
| Item2       | Enum value "Item2"     |
