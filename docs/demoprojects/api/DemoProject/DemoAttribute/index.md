# DemoAttribute Class

**Namespace:** [DemoProject](../index.md)  
**Assembly:** DemoProject

An example of an custom attribute class for methods

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]
public class DemoAttribute : Attribute
```

**Inheritance:** object → Attribute → DemoAttribute

**Attributes:** AttributeUsageAttribute

## Remarks

This page demonstrates how the generated documentation for attribute classes looks like. The same layout is used for all classes, see [DemoClass](../DemoClass/index.md) for a more detailed description

What can be seen on this page is that the definition section includes a type's custom attribute including the attribute's constructor parameters, in this case `[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]`

## Constructors
