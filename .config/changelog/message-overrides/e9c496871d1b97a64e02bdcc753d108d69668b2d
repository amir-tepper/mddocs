feat(apireference): Add multi-assembly support

Add support for rendering API reference documentation for multiple assemblies. 
When multiple assemblies are specified, documentation is generated for all types from all assemblies.
The file layout of the output is unchanged and is based on a symbol's name and namespace.

Specifying multiple input assemblies is supported in the MdDocs command line tool but not in the MdDocs MSBuild task which continues to generate documentation for the current project's output assembly.

BREAKING CHANGE: The mddocs:apireference:assemblyPath setting was renamed to mddocs:apireference:assemblyPaths and its type was changed from a string to an array of strings
BREAKING CHANGE: The '--assembly' command line parameter of the apireference command has been renamed to '--assemblies'
