feat(cli): Allow mddocs to run on newer versions of .NET by default

Enable .NET runtime setting to allow running mddocs on newer versions of .NET if none of the supported runtimes are available.

This means - while currently, the mddocs CLI tool supports .NET 6 and .NET 7, it will use the .NET 8 or newer runtime when no version of .NET 6 or .NET 7 is installed.
