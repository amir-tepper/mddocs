fix: Make sorting in output consistent across different frameworks

.NET 5 changed the default sorting behavior for strings causing the output of MdDocs to be different when running on net5.0 vs. running on earlier .NET Core versions or .NET Framework.

Make sorting consistent by explicitly using "Ordinal" comparisons for all sort operations.
